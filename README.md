**This program includes files that are from the CSGO directory which I have not created myself, but are required to be included in order for the mod to run. This mod may break on any CSGO update**

### Installation
Download and extract folder to Counter-Strike Global Offensive, rename as ` mymod `. Running ` mymod.bat ` should launch the mod.

Running `mymod_test.bat` loads into the included test map immediately after launching the mod.
Running `mymod_create_shortcut.bat` adds the mod to your steam library (you may need to relaunch steam). Please note that the shortcut creation .bat and the gameinfo it copies assume you have installed steam at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`
