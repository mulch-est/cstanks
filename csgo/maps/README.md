# Info
The map included is a test map that uses the changes applied by the mod to build a playable tank.

Currently, the map closely resembles the one released by selfish player in [this tank tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h85NEPUwV0g), as the tanks in this mod are based on selfish player's innovations.
